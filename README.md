# 3D Product Customization Platform - Documentation

## Overview

The 3D Product Customization Platform is an interactive web application that allows users to customize various 3D models by changing the colors of different parts. The application provides a real-time 3D preview of the customized product and calculates the price based on the customizations made.

## Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture using React. The main components are:

1. **CustomizationPage**: The main container component that manages the overall state and layout.
2. **ModelViewer**: Handles the 3D rendering and interaction with the model.
3. **CustomizationPanel**: Provides the UI for selecting parts and colors.
4. **Model Components**: Individual 3D model components (Shoe, Rocket, Insect, Teapot, Axe).

## Key Features

- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Users can rotate, zoom, and interact with 3D models.
- **Part Selection**: Users can select different parts of the 3D model by clicking on them.
- **Color Customization**: Each part can be customized with different colors.
- **Real-time Price Calculation**: The price updates in real-time based on customizations.
- **Collapsible UI**: The customization panel can be hidden to provide a better view of the 3D model.
- **Camera Animation**: The camera animates to focus on the selected part.
- **Part Navigation**: Users can navigate between parts using arrow buttons.

## Technical Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface
- **React Three Fiber/drei**: For 3D rendering and interaction
- **Framer Motion**: For animations and transitions
- **Valtio**: For state management
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling

## Component Details

### CustomizationPage

The main container component that manages the overall state and layout of the customization page.

**Props**: None

**State**:
- `selectedPart`: Currently selected part of the model
- `animating`: Boolean indicating if camera animation is in progress
- `isPanelOpen`: Boolean indicating if the customization panel is visible

**Key Functions**:
- `handleUpdateSelectedPart`: Updates the selected part and triggers camera animation
- `updateColorForPart`: Updates the color of a specific part
- `togglePanel`: Toggles the visibility of the customization panel

### ModelViewer

Handles the 3D rendering and interaction with the model.

**Props**:
- `modelId`: ID of the model to display
- `modelState`: State object for the model
- `snap`: Snapshot of the model state
- `animating`: Boolean indicating if camera animation is in progress
- `onUpdateSelectedPart`: Callback function when a part is selected

**Key Functions**:
- `getModelComponent`: Returns the appropriate model component based on modelId
- `animateToSelectedPart`: Animates the camera to focus on the selected part

### BottomCustomizationPanel

Provides the UI for selecting parts and colors.

**Props**:
- `snap`: Snapshot of the model state
- `modelState`: State object for the model
- `onColorChange`: Callback function when a color is selected
- `onAddToCart`: Callback function when the "Add to Cart" button is clicked

**State**:
- `currentPartIndex`: Index of the currently selected part
- `availableParts`: Array of available parts for the model

**Key Functions**:
- `goToPreviousPart`: Navigates to the previous part
- `goToNextPart`: Navigates to the next part
- `handleColorSelect`: Updates the color of the current part

### Model Components (Shoe, Rocket, etc.)

Individual 3D model components that render the model and handle interactions.

**Props**:
- `colors`: Object containing colors for each part
- `updateCurrent`: Callback function when a part is clicked

**State**:
- `hovered`: Currently hovered part

**Key Functions**:
- Event handlers for pointer interactions (hover, click)

## State Management

The application uses Valtio for state management. Each model has its own state object that contains:

- `colors`: Object mapping part names to colors
- `parts`: Object containing metadata about each part
- `current`: Currently selected part
- `basePrice`: Base price of the model
- `customizationPrice`: Additional price based on customizations
- `presets`: Predefined color combinations

## User Flow

1. User selects a model from the catalog (not shown in the code)
2. User is directed to the customization page for the selected model
3. User can:
   - Rotate and zoom the 3D model
   - Click on parts to select them
   - Use the navigation arrows to cycle through parts
   - Select colors from the color palette
   - Hide/show the customization panel
   - Add the customized product to the cart

## Error Handling

The application includes several error handling mechanisms:

- Default values for colors to prevent undefined errors
- Conditional rendering to handle loading states
- Checks for undefined or null values before accessing properties

## Performance Considerations

- Suspense and lazy loading for 3D models
- Optimized camera animations
- Efficient state management with Valtio

## Extensibility

The application is designed to be easily extensible:

- Adding new models requires creating a new model component and updating the model state map
- Adding new customization options can be done by extending the parts and colors objects
- The UI can be customized by modifying the customization panel component

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for the application include:

- Material customization in addition to colors
- Texture mapping
- Saving and sharing customizations
- User accounts and saved designs
- More advanced pricing models
- Additional 3D models and parts
- Mobile optimization

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Ensure 3D model files are placed in the correct directories:
   - `/public/Shoe/shoe.gltf`
   - `/public/Rocket/scene.gltf`
   - `/public/Insect/scene.gltf`
   - `/public/Teapot/scene.gltf`
   - `/public/Axe/scene.gltf`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to any static hosting service:

1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the contents of the `build` directory

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **3D models not loading**: Ensure the model files are in the correct location and format
- **Color changes not applying**: Check that the material names in the model components match the keys in the colors object
- **Camera animation issues**: Verify that the OrbitControls reference is correctly set up
- **State updates not reflecting**: Ensure that the state is being properly updated using the appropriate functions
